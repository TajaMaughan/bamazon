# Bamazon Node.js Application
The purpose of this application is to allow a customer to purchase a product and allow a manager to update and create inventory listings.
## Customer Interface
When the customer file is initiated it will give them a list of avaliable products and ask them what they would like to buy.

After the user selects a product and the number they would like to buy of the product, the program will give a total for the purchase. I wasn't able to figure out how to get it to round to the thousandths place on the dollar amount.

If the user tries to buy more than of a product that there is stock of, it will tell the user that there isn't enough and to restart their purchase.
